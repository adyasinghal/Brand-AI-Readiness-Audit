"""analyze_rendering.py -- raw vs rendered content gaps (v4.0 section 8.2).

Two tiers, matching common/capabilities.py:
  - "rendering_gap_heuristic" (executable, always runs): flags pages whose raw HTML
    shows near-zero visible text -- a real, evidence-backed signal that needs no
    browser, but on its own can't distinguish "needs JS" from "genuinely thin page".
  - "rendering_headless_browser" (fallback/optional): when a real headless browser
    is available (see capabilities.detect_capabilities), every heuristic-flagged page
    is actually re-rendered and compared against the static fetch. A page is only a
    *confirmed* defect when rendering reveals substantial content the raw HTML
    lacked; if rendering also comes back thin (or fails), that page is not a
    confirmed gap -- it's insufficient evidence, not a fabricated defect. Bounded by
    MAX_RENDERED_PAGES and PER_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS; a single page's render failure
    never aborts the batch.

Returns gap pages only via SkillResult.metrics; never writes back into PageArtifact.
