"""analyze_crawlability.py -- reachability, robots, sitemap, orphans (v4.0 section 8.2).

Robots calibration: general_disallow is only a concrete True/False when
robots.txt was actually retrieved and parsed (acquire_site sets it to None on
timeout/inaccessible/malformed/blocked). A confirmed "disallows crawling" defect
requires general_disallow is True; a robots.txt we could not check is reported as
insufficient evidence, never inferred as a block (Invariant I-1).
