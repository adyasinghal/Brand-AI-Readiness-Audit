"""ingest_agent_findings.py -- in-process bridge for the agent-executed stage.

The entity-corroboration-agent skill is the one qualitative stage in this
marketplace: the calling agent, not a deterministic script, judges About-page
concreteness (AG-01) and cross-web agreement or contradiction (AG-02 / AG-03)
using its own reading and web_search tools, per the handout's explicit allowance
to query public community platforms such as Reddit and Quora. That judgment is
handed back as a small JSON array; this module ingests it in-process and returns
a SkillResult in exactly the same shape as every other v6 specialist.

Re-plumbed for v6 (Step 2.0): the donor ran this as a subprocess with a workdir
JSON handoff. Here there is no subprocess and no second orchestration model. The
orchestrator calls ingest_agent_findings() as an ordinary in-process function on
the shared immutable AuditArtifacts snapshot, and every ingested finding is
reconstructed through common.models.make_finding, so the catalog enrichment and
Invariant I-1 capping that govern script findings govern agent findings too. The
agent never constructs the final finding object; it supplies only what it
observed.

Graceful skip (Step 2.5 requirement): when no agent findings are supplied -- the
common case in an evaluation harness that has not run the qualitative stage --
the stage records not_supplied and returns insufficient_evidence. It never
upgrades "the stage did not run" into "no corroboration exists"; that asymmetry
is the single most common way an audit manufactures a false negative.
