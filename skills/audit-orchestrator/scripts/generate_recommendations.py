"""generate_recommendations.py -- proactive recommendation layer.

Guarantees every successful audit ships a useful, first-class recommendations
section, even when: no defects are confirmed, all evidence is insufficient, the
site is small, or the site is already well-structured. Recommendations are:

  - evidence-aware   : derived from actual SkillResult/metrics/findings, not invented.
  - non-duplicative  : reuse merge_findings' normalize/similarity logic so a
                        recommendation never restates a confirmed defect's fix.
  - calibrated       : confidence and specificity reflect how much evidence backs them.
  - separated        : always finding_type == "proactive_improvement", carried in the
                        report's own `recommendations` array, never mixed into
                        `findings`.
