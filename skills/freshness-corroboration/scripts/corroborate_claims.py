"""corroborate_claims.py -- consumes the shared identity artifact; bounded external
checks.

Round-3 handout, Priority 2 #11/#4 calibration this module enforces:
  - compares claim VALUES against result content, not just "did a search return
    anything" -- a claim is corroborated only when its normalized value actually
    appears in an independent result, and is flagged as suspected-contradicted
    only when a *different* value of the same shape (phone/price/date) is found
    and the claim's own value is not
  - "not checked" (provider unconfigured/failed) is never conflated with
    "not found" (a real search ran and found nothing matching)
  - the actual query issued for each fact is recorded (bounded), not just a count
  - zero search results/unavailable providers/incomplete queries never create a
    confirmed defect -- contradictions are reported as `status="suspected"`,
    never `"confirmed"` (Invariant I-1 does not require this, but the absence-of-
    proof asymmetry does: a search-based mismatch is evidence of a discrepancy
    worth checking, not proof one exists)
