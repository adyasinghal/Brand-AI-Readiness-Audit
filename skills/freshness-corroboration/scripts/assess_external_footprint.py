"""assess_external_footprint.py -- calibrated footprint findings (v4.0 section 5, 8.3).
Search non-detection is never proof of real-world absence. Uses the pluggable
search_provider (fallback/optional capability); degrades to insufficient_evidence,
never a confirmed absence, whenever the provider is unconfigured or fails.

Round-3 handout, Priority 2 #4 additions: the actual query strings issued are
recorded (bounded, for reproducibility); "source quality" is approximated by
counting distinct domains among matched hits (source_diversity) -- a handful of
hits from the same domain is weaker signal than the same count spread across
independent domains, even though both count the same toward `matched_hits`."""
