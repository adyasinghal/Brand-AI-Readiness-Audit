"""extract_claims.py -- heuristic, deterministic claim extraction.

Each claim is tagged with a `category` -- operational / commercial / contact /
editorial / historical / legal -- in addition to its shape-based `type`
(date/price/contact/structured). The category matters downstream (assess_freshness)
because "this date is old" means something completely different depending on what
kind of fact it is attached to: an old copyright year (legal) is normal and not a
defect, an old founding-story date (historical) is *supposed* to be old, an old
"last verified" operational date is a real freshness problem, and a stale price or
expired offer (commercial) is the highest-stakes case. Category is inferred from
the page it was found on (page_type, set during acquisition) and, for structured
facts, from which JSON-LD key produced it -- never from an analysis conclusion, so
it stays a plain classification of what the fact IS, not a verdict on it.
