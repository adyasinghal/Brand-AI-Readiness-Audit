"""build_site_graph.py -- immutable graph artifact: degree, orphan/dead-end status,
clusters, importance, and crawl-scope accounting.

Two additions beyond flat in/out-degree:
  - Weakly-connected clusters: in-degree alone can't tell "one orphan page" apart
    from "a whole sub-section of the site that's disconnected from the main
    navigation" -- the latter is a much bigger engagement problem and needs its
    own finding, not N separate orphan-page findings.
  - Crawl-scope accounting: orphan/dead-end status is only ever a statement about
    the CRAWLED subgraph. If the crawl didn't reach every discovered URL (hit
    MAX_PAGES_CRAWLED, MAX_CRAWL_DEPTH, or the deadline), a page that looks like an
    orphan here might actually be linked from a page that was never fetched -- so
    that must be recorded and surfaced, not silently treated as equivalent to a
    complete-crawl orphan finding.
