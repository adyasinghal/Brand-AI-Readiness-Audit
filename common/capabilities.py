"""capabilities.py -- central registry distinguishing what actually runs in this
deployment from what is architecturally described but environment-gated.

Three tiers, surfaced in every report's coverage.capabilities block:
  - "executable"  : runs today, no external dependency beyond what's already used.
  - "fallback"     : has a real primary implementation, but degrades to a documented
                     fallback when a dependency (headless browser, search provider,
                     outbound network) is unavailable -- the fallback itself is
                     executable and evidence-honest (insufficient_evidence), never
                     a silent skip.
  - "optional"     : the enhanced path only; whether it actually ran this audit.
