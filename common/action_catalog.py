"""action_catalog.py -- ticket-level action content and evidence-status modes.

Ported from the donor's rich action catalog (2.4) and adapted to v6's in-process
model. Two responsibilities, both kept out of the detection scripts so the wording
is reviewed once and stays consistent:

1. Baseline action content. When the recommendation engine emits a
   category-level proactive item (no confirmed defect in that category), it draws
   concrete steps, implementation_detail, expected_outcome and verification from
   here instead of a thin inline stub. Detectors still own observed evidence; this
   only enriches the always-on maintenance recommendations.

2. Evidence-status modes. A single explicit mapping from a finding/recommendation
   status to a short reader-facing description of what that status means. This
   makes the confirmed / suspected / insufficient_evidence distinction explicit on
   every recommendation rather than implicit in the numbers. It records the meaning
   of a status; it never changes severity or type, which remain governed by
   Invariant I-1 (make_finding / apply_invariant_i1).
